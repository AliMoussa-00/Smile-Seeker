# Smile Seeker Backend

Welcome to the backend repository for Smile Seeker, a web application for managing dental appointments. This repository contains the server-side code written in Python using the Flask framework, database schemas, API endpoints, and related documentation.

## Overview

Smile Seeker Backend is responsible for handling all server-side logic, data storage, and communication with the frontend of the application. It provides RESTful APIs for performing various operations, such as user authentication, appointment booking, and review management.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Backend logic is implemented using Python, a versatile and high-level programming language.
- **Flask**: The Flask web framework is used for routing, request handling, and building RESTful APIs.
- **SQLAlchemy**: SQLAlchemy is used as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for interacting with the database.
- **MariaDB**: MariaDB is used as the relational database management system for storing application data.
